    Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of the value added created
    through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period.
    As such, it also measures the income earned from that production, or the total amount
    spent on final goods and services (less imports). While GDP is the single most important
    indicator to capture economic activity, it falls short of providing a suitable measure of
    people's material well-being for which alternative indicators may be more appropriate.
    This indicator is based on nominal GDP (also called GDP at current prices or GDP in value)
    and is available in different measures: US dollars and US dollars per capita (current PPPs).
    All OECD countries compile their data according to the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA).
    This indicator is less suited for comparisons over time, as developments are not only caused
    by real growth, but also by changes in prices and PPPs. [Source: OECD]

    Inflation measured by consumer price index (CPI) is defined as the change in the prices

    2015 base year with a breakdown for food, energy and total excluding food and energy.
    Inflation measures the erosion of living standards. A consumer price index is estimated
    as a series of summary measures of the period-to-period proportional change in the
    prices of a fixed set of consumer goods and services of constant quantity and
    characteristics, acquired, used or paid for by the reference population. Each summary
    measure is constructed as a weighted average of a large number of elementary aggregate indices.
    Each of the elementary aggregate indices is estimated using a sample of prices for a defined
    set of goods and services obtained in, or by residents of, a specific region from a given
    set of outlets or other sources of consumption goods and services. [Source: OECD]
