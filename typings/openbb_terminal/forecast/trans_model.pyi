    Parameters
    ----------
    data: Union[pd.Series, pd.DataFrame]
        Input Data
    n_predict: int
        Days to predict. Defaults to 5.
    target_column: str
        Target column to forecast. Defaults to "close".
    train_split: float
        Train/val split. Defaults to 0.85.
    past_covariates: str
        Multiple secondary columns to factor in when forecasting. Defaults to None.
    forecast_horizon: int
        Forecast horizon when performing historical forecasting. Defaults to 5.
    input_chunk_length: int
        Number of past time steps that are fed to the forecasting module at prediction time. Defaults to 14.
    output_chunk_length: int
        The length of the forecast of the model. Defaults to 5.
    d_model: int
        The number of expected features in the encoder/decoder inputs. Defaults to 64.
    nhead: int
        The number of heads in the multi-head attention mechanism. Defaults to 4.
    num_encoder_layers: int
        The number of encoder layers in the encoder. Defaults to 3.
    num_decoder_layers: int
        The number of decoder layers in the encoder. Defaults to 3.
    dim_feedforward: int
        The dimension of the feedforward network model. Defaults to 512.
    activation: str
        The activation function of encoder/decoder intermediate layer, ‘relu’ or ‘gelu’. Defaults to 'relu'.
    dropout: float
        Fraction of neurons afected by Dropout. Defaults to 0.0.
    batch_size: int
        Number of time series (input and output sequences) used in each training pass. Defaults to 32.
    n_epochs: int
        Number of epochs over which to train the model. Defaults to 100.
    learning_rate: float
        Defaults to 1e-3.
    model_save_name: str
        Name for model. Defaults to "brnn_model".
    force_reset: bool
        If set to True, any previously-existing model with the same name will be reset (all checkpoints will be
        discarded). Defaults to True.
    save_checkpoints: bool
        Whether or not to automatically save the untrained model and checkpoints from training. Defaults to True.
    metric: str
        Metric to use for model selection. Defaults to "mape".

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[List[TimeSeries], List[TimeSeries], List[TimeSeries], Optional[float], type[TransformerModel]]
        Adjusted Data series,
        Historical forecast by best RNN model,
        list of Predictions,
        Mean average precision error,
        Best transformer Model.
