    Parameters
    ----------
    data: Union[pd.Series, pd.DataFrame]
        Input Data
    target_column: str
        Target column to forecast. Defaults to "close".
    dataset_name: str
        The name of the ticker to be predicted
    n_predict: int
        Days to predict. Defaults to 5.
    train_split: float
        Train/val split. Defaults to 0.85.
    past_covariates: str
        Multiple secondary columns to factor in when forecasting. Defaults to None.
    forecast_horizon: int
        Forecast horizon when performing historical forecasting. Defaults to 5.
    input_chunk_length: int
        Number of past time steps that are fed to the forecasting module at prediction time. Defaults to 14.
    output_chunk_length: int
        The length of the forecast of the model. Defaults to 5.
    num_stacks: int
        The number of stacks that make up the whole model. Defaults to 10.
    num_blocks: int
        The number of blocks making up every stack. Defaults to 3.
    num_layers: int
        The number of fully connected layers preceding the final forking layers in each block
        of every stack. Defaults to 4.
    layer_widths: int
        Determines the number of neurons that make up each fully connected layer in each block
        of every stack. Defaults to 512.
    batch_size: int
        Number of time series (input and output sequences) used in each training pass. Defaults
        to 32.
    n_epochs: int
        Number of epochs over which to train the model. Defaults to 100.
    learning_rate: float
        Defaults to 1e-3.
    model_save_name: str
        Name for model. Defaults to "brnn_model".
    force_reset: bool
        If set to True, any previously-existing model with the same name will be reset (all
        checkpoints will be discarded). Defaults to True.
    save_checkpoints: bool
        Whether or not to automatically save the untrained model and checkpoints from training.
        Defaults to True.
    sheet_name: str
        Optionally specify the name of the sheet the data is exported to.
    export: str
        Format to export data
    residuals: bool
        Whether to show residuals for the model. Defaults to False.
    forecast_only: bool
        Whether to only show dates in the forecasting range. Defaults to False.
    start_date: Optional[datetime]
        The starting date to perform analysis, data before this is trimmed. Defaults to None.
    end_date: Optional[datetime]
        The ending date to perform analysis, data after this is trimmed. Defaults to None.
    naive: bool
        Whether to show the naive baseline. This just assumes the closing price will be the same
        as the previous day's closing price. Defaults to False.
    export_pred_raw: bool
        Whether to export the raw predicted values. Defaults to False.
    metric: str
        Metric to use for evaluation. Defaults to "mape".
    external_axes : bool, optional
        Whether to return the figure object or not, by default False
