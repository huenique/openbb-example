    past_covariates (str, optional):
        Multiple secondary columns to factor in when forecasting. Defaults to None.
    forecast_horizon (int, optional):
        Forecast horizon when performing historical forecasting. Defaults to 5.
    input_chunk_length (int, optional):
        Number of past time steps that are fed to the forecasting module at prediction time.
        Defaults to 14.
    output_chunk_length (int, optional):
        The length of the forecast of the model. Defaults to 5.
    hidden_size (int, optional):
        Hidden state size of the TFT. Defaults to 16.

        The name for the model. Defaults to tft_model
    force_reset (bool, optional):
        If set to True, any previously-existing model with the same name will be reset
        (all checkpoints will be discarded). Defaults to True.

        Whether or not to automatically save the untrained model and checkpoints from training.
        Defaults to True.
