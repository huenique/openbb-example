    """Gets interest rates data from selected countries (3 month and 10 year)

    Short-term interest rates are the rates at which short-term borrowings are effected between financial
    institutions or the rate at which short-term government paper is issued or traded in the market. Short-term
    interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. Short-term interest rates are
    based on three-month money market rates where available. Typical standardised names are "money market rate" and
    "treasury bill rate".

    Long-term interest rates refer to government bonds maturing in ten years. Rates are mainly determined by the
    price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long-term interest
    rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest rates are implied by the
    prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans
    were issued. In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term
    interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long-term interest rates encourage
    investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of
    economic growth.
